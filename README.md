# SimpleLock

# Ideas:

## Features:
- [x] UUIDs instead of player names... (Really Lockette/Deadbolt... names are not a way of saving data...)
- [x] Have a sign placed on a container/door/ETC... will register the block/lockation
- [x] On the sign it will display the Username of the player that placed the sign
- [x] Sign info should be stored in a single STC(StorageTagCompount) file
- [x] Have a Add/Trust system (Like PlotSquared) where if the player is added... they can only access the block when the owner is online...
	but if they are trusted... they can access it when they are offline
- [ ] An Options GUI to allow the sign owner to enable/disable features...
- [ ] Friends system (They will always be trusted unless the sign says otherwise)
	
## NEEDED:
- [ ] A way to transfer Private chests from Lockette/Deadbolt to the new system
	
## Commands:
- [x] /sl add <player>
- [x] /sl remove <player>
- [x] /sl trust <player>
- [x] /sl temp <player> <seconds>
- [x] /sl info
- [ ] /sl update
- [ ] /sl debug
